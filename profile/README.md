# Omniforge

🚀 Zero-config platform for deploying microservices anywhere - VMs, containers, or bare metal - with just 24MB RAM overhead.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Deploy directly from your project directory
omni up
```
That's it! Omniforge automatically detects your project type and deploys it to your configured provider, if there is no configuration Omni will select everything automatically.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Using GRIP
grip install omni-cli

# Or download the binary
curl -L https://omni-forge.github.io/get | sh
```
